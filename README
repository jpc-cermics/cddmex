This is a CDD interface for Nsp, based on CDDMEX by M. Baotic.

The CDD library written by Komei Fukuda 
(http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~fukuda/soft/cdd_home/cdd.html).
The version inserted here is the version 0.94b
CDD is a software package which boasts a wide array
of efficient algorithms for many polytope manipulations as well as a fast
LP solver. The full CDD library is free and availible from:
http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~fukuda/soft/cdd_home/cdd.html

CDDMEX is a Matlab MEX file interface (authors: Mato Baotic, Fabio Torrisi),
to the CDD library. It enables calls to some of CDD functions from within 
MATLAB. 
Since the matlab mex functions are emulated in Nsp, the cddmex package 
can be compiled and loaded in Nsp to enable calls to some of CDD functions 
from within Nso.
The CDDMEX source code is available at:
    http://control.ee.ethz.ch/~hybrid/cdd.msql
The version used here is 1.0

To run CDD under enter 
   -->exec loader.sce
at Nsp prompt.

You need first to compile the package by entering exec('builder.sce')
at Nsp prompt.

The help file is cddmex.help (plain ascii = original cddmex.m file for matlab).
Examples can be run by copy-paste of .sci files.
