This is a CDD interface for Scilab, based on CDDMEX by M. Baotic.
It runs under Linux.

The main library is libcdd.so, built in the libcdd directory.
It is a dynamic libary constructed from the CDD package written by
K. Fukuda. The home page is:

CDDMEX is a Matlab MEX file interface (authors: Mato Baotic, Fabio Torrisi),
obtained by linking CDD library CDDLIB-093 (author: Komei Fukuda), which
allows calls to some of CDD functions from within MATLAB.

CDDMEX has been adapted to Scilab by a builder file which recompile
cddmex.c. 

CDD is a software package written by K. Fukuda which boasts a wide array
of efficient algorithms for many polytope manipulations as well as a fast
LP solver. The full CDD library is free and availible from:
http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~fukuda/soft/cdd_home/cdd.html

Version: cddmex v1.0
          cddlib v0.

The CDD source code package is from:
http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~fukuda/download/cdd/

The CDDMEX source code is available at:
http://control.ee.ethz.ch/~hybrid/cdd.msql

To run CDD under Linux enter 
-->exec loader.sce
at Scilab prompt.

The help file is cddmex.help (plain ascii = original cddmex.m file for matlab).
Examples can be run by copy-paste of .sci files.

How to rebuild cddmex for Scilab:
1/Go to libcdd directory  and clean it : ie rm Path.incl Makelib *.a *.o *.so *.la there and the .libs directory.
2/run scilab to build libcdd.so shared library:
-->exec builder.sce;
3/Go to cddmexscilab main directory and clean it.
run scilab to build libcddmex.so shared library:
-->exec builder.sce;
4/Load cddmex function
-->exec loader.sce;

To test simple examples : exec ess1.sci  etc ...
